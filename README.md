# Description of the project
You'll be chasing a spaceship in the city as debris is launched into you so you have to dodge and stay on track with the ship or you'll lose. This is trying to simulate you flying as Superman and the background and maybe the way the enemy attacks is affected by the tunes you add to the game.
# Instructions for use
Currently on PC: WASD to move, Q to Descend and E to Ascend
VR: Tilt both controllers to move, the left button to Ascend and the right button to Descend

 # What I am most proud of in the assignment
# What I learned
# Proposal:
The player would fly towards a ship(VR or AR) using motion control. The attacks/obstacles would depend on the music you add. The building around would bounce to the tones(That's if on VR) Controls will be motion aka for VR you'll have 2 arms out and tilt the direction you want to go for AR you tilt your phone. Leaning to AR since my current laptop might not be able to handle VR and my stronger one is still getting repaired without an end in sight. Groovy on music and lighting, complex with attacks and balancing, hopefully getting a system done a week but depends on other assignments. All on unity.
